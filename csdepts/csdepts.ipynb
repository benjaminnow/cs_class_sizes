    "As a UMD student, we have [Testudo](https://app.testudo.umd.edu/soc/) which lists our schedule of classes with their associated class sizes. I can scrape this page to get the CS class sizes at UMD. I assumed other public universities would have similar systems but they would all be different and would take time for me to learn. To solve this problem, I made several Reddit posts asking for similar systems to Testudo at other universities on their associated subreddits. Students on Reddit were very helpful and gave me tips on how to get what I was looking for, and this saved me a lot of time.\n",

    "UMD students created a website called PlanetTerp which has course reviews, instructor reviews, and grade distribution data. I used their public API to get CS course enrollment information for the fall 2021 semester. Their api documentation can be found here: https://api.planetterp.com/#planetterp-api\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step was getting a list of CS courses offered by UMD, and I did this by calling their \"courses\" endpoint and searching for CS classes which are prefixed with \"CMSC\" at UMD. I changed the default class return limit to 300 because UMD has offered over 100 different CS courses over the years. I also extract the professors which have taught each of these courses over the years because this will help me determine section sizes for the fall 2021 semester.\n",
    "\n",
    "I then use PlanetTerp's \"grades\" endpoint to get the course grades for the fall 2021 semester of a certain course with a certain professor. If that professor wasn't teaching that semester but has taught in the past, the api would return 0 for them. This endpoint returns all the sections of that professor, which for some courses is the sizes of a bunch of their discussions. Some cleaning of the data needs to be done to get their lecture size.\n",

    "Georgia Tech has a public class registry called Oscar located at:  https://oscar.gatech.edu/. The user can search for all CS courses in a specific term and Oscar will generate a static HTML page response that can be scraped for data. However, it takes a long time for this query to execute so I saved this HTML page locally to then be loaded by my program later. I used the Python package [Uncurl](https://github.com/spulec/uncurl) to generate the appropriate POST request. My code to get the HTML is below:"
