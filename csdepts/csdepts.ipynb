    "As a UMD student, we have [Testudo](https://app.testudo.umd.edu/soc/) which lists our schedule of classes with their associated class sizes. I can scrape this page to get the CS class sizes at UMD. I assumed other public universities would have similar systems but they would all be different and would take time for me to learn. To solve this problem, I made several Reddit posts asking for similar systems to Testudo at other universities on their associated subreddits. Students on Reddit were very helpful and gave me tips on how to get what I was looking for, and this saved me a lot of time.\n",

    "UMD students created a website called PlanetTerp which has course reviews, instructor reviews, and grade distribution data. I used their public API to get CS course enrollment information for the fall 2021 semester. Their api documentation can be found here: https://api.planetterp.com/#planetterp-api\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step was getting a list of CS courses offered by UMD, and I did this by calling their \"courses\" endpoint and searching for CS classes which are prefixed with \"CMSC\" at UMD. I changed the default class return limit to 300 because UMD has offered over 100 different CS courses over the years. I also extract the professors which have taught each of these courses over the years because this will help me determine section sizes for the fall 2021 semester.\n",
    "\n",
    "I then use PlanetTerp's \"grades\" endpoint to get the course grades for the fall 2021 semester of a certain course with a certain professor. If that professor wasn't teaching that semester but has taught in the past, the api would return 0 for them. This endpoint returns all the sections of that professor, which for some courses is the sizes of a bunch of their discussions. Some cleaning of the data needs to be done to get their lecture size.\n",

    "Georgia Tech has a public class registry called Oscar located at:  https://oscar.gatech.edu/. The user can search for all CS courses in a specific term and Oscar will generate a static HTML page response that can be scraped for data. However, it takes a long time for this query to execute so I saved this HTML page locally to then be loaded by my program later. I used the Python package [Uncurl](https://github.com/spulec/uncurl) to generate the appropriate POST request. My code to get the HTML is below:"

    "One thing to note is that not all these faculty would necessarily be in the CS departments at their institution. CSRankings is just tracking faculty which have papers accepted in CS related conferences. For example, it is possible for a mechanical engineering professor to be added towards an institution's count if they get a paper accepted to a robotics conference. While these professors may be in different departments, I would still count them towards total CS faculty because CS students can get involved in their projects and could possibly take classes with them.

    "\n",
    "Since my project is looking to examine the resources available to CS students at particular institutions, I need to know how many CS students there are at these places. At first I just tried to find how many CS majors there were at each of these institutions. A problem was that many places didn't have this listed publicly and I would have to reach out in private correspondance. I did try reaching out to several schools but only one ended up getting back to me (thanks Professor Sahami at Stanford!).\n",
    "\n",
    "If I couldn't get current CS major counts by institution, I needed a source which would be publicly available for all institutions. Thus, I landed on degrees conferred. This is a better source because many universities, public and private, report the degrees they confer at the end of the year by major. They usually do this in their office of institutional research. If the data is not available, many universities also report degrees conferred to the government in the [IPEDS](https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/) system. And then some CS departments also state on their website in usually an \"about us\" section how many CS degrees they awarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Degrees awarded can be used to make a conservative estimate of how many CS majors are in a department. With the fair assumption that CS is growing more popular every year, the amount of degrees awaded per year multiplied by 4 for all years of students will result in a underestimate of total CS majors.\n",

    "Cornell University - Their institutional research website didn't report how many CS degrees were conferred but instead lumped all engineering majors together. IPEDS had old data, so I looked at the Cornell CS department website where they say that they awarded over 300 degrees. I'm going to assume that the website is regularly updated and this is the most recent years' figure.\n",

    "University of Washington - The same thing here as Cornell. Their CS department website said they awarded over 450 degrees and I'm going to assume that this is for the most recent year.\n",

    "Most recent year - While many schools had data for the most recent school year, a few only had data up to the 19-20 school year. In the case of NYU, they only had data up to the 18-19 school year. This means their estimated CS majors, if going with the assumption that CS class sizes are only growing, will be more of an underestimate than schools with more recent data."

I collected data manually from LinkedIn on each school's alumni at these companies. One cool feature of LinkedIn is that if you go to a school's profile, then go to the Alumni tab, you'll find a table called \"Where they work\". For everyone on LinkedIn who has this school listed, it adds their company to the school's where they work table so you can see how many people work at that company from that school.\n",

    "One caveat, though, is that not all the people at these tech companies are software engineers. They could be artists, business people, or logistics workers. This data is mostly collected for fun and needs to be taken with a big grain of salt when trying to evaluate big tech placement for each school."

    "Since public schools have differing in-state and out-of-state rates, I will want to combine these into a single number for my analysis. My assumptions are that public schools are generally good for CS, so students are willing to go out of state for them. This is supported by my own and anecdotal experience at UMD and my friends at other public universities. A safe estimate is that 25% of CS majors at public universities are out of state. Thus to get the cost for public universities it is 0.75(in-state rate) + 0.25(out-of-state rate). I'll make a new dataframe to show the cost by school."
